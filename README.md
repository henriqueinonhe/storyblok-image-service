# Storyblok Image Service

[Storyblok Image Service](https://www.storyblok.com/docs/image-service) JS SDK.

- üöÄ Production Ready!
- ‚úîÔ∏è 100% Code Coverage!
- ‚òëÔ∏è Out-of-the-box Typescript Support!
- üì¶ No Dependencies!
- ‚ú® Awesome DX!

Storyblok offers an [Image Service](https://www.storyblok.com/docs/image-service) to pre-process images hosted on your Storyblok space, so that you can resize, crop, optimize and add other awesome filters to your images **on the fly**, which frees the marketing/content/design team from having to deal with any of these concerns themselves.

Use this SDK to make processing your Storyblok-hosted images easier than ever!

## Installation

```sh
npm install storyblok-image-service
```

## Usage

```ts
import { imageUrl } from "storyblok-image-service";

const originalImageUrl =
  "https://a.storyblok.com/f/39898/3310x2192/e4ec08624e/demo-image.jpeg";

const processedImageUrl = imageUrl(originalImageUrl, {
  resize: {
    height: 100,
    width: 1200,
  },
  quality: 80,
});
```

## Features

Most features come from Storyblok Image Service itself:

- Automatic WebP Detection
- Image Resizing/Cropping
- Smart Focus for Human Faces
- Image Quality
- Blurring
- Image Format Conversion (e.g. jpeg, png, webp)
- Rotating
- Flippling
- Brightness
- Grayscale

Besides these image processing features offered by Storyblok Image Service, this SDK offers a friendly API that is **easy to use correctly** and also adopts a very **defensive approach**, which even if for some reason you pass invalid values, it will try to correct them to reasonable approximate values to avoid breaking the image service and hence having broken images.

## API

This lib exposes a single function `imageUrl` that takes the original Storyblok-hosted image URL and some parameters and returns the URL of the processed image.

### imageUrl

```ts
declare const imageUrl = (
  originalImageUrl: string,
  parameters: {
    /**
     * Force a specific image format.
     * Supported formats are "webp", "jpeg" and "png".
     *
     * If not set, Storyblok Image Service will detect
     * whether the user's browser has support to WebP,
     * and then either send the image in WebP or fallback
     * to JPG.
     */

     * Floats will be rounded, negative values will be
     * brought to 0, values over 100 will be brought
     * to 100 and an error will be issued.
